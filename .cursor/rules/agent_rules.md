# Agent Rules

- Begin replies with a fox emoji.
- Preserve comments; separate I/O and logic; only add requested functionality.
- For Python, use 3.9+ type hints. This repo is TypeScript; follow its style.
- Plan before implementing; write specs in `.cursor/docs` for major features.
- Keep files < 500 LOC; small, single-purpose functions; clear names.
- Maintain docs: `project_checklist.md`, `agentnotes.md`, `notebook.md`.
- Continuous testing: unit, integration, and feature tests under `tests/`.
